<p>
The word frequency lists available here contain important information about
word statistics (frequency and dispersion) in contemporary spoken language.
</p>

<p>
For each language, the wordlists are generated by selecting randomly a large number of subtitles files from the monolingual part of
the <a href="http://opus.nlpl.eu/OpenSubtitles-v2018.php"> OpenSubtitles corpus 2018</a>.
</p>

<p>
Here, we present lemmatized lists, where all words sharing the same base form (so-called <i>lemma</i>)
are represented by a single row.
</p>

<p>
To illustrate the concept of lemmatized lists, let us consider the verb "to make". All its forms, e.g.
"making", "made", "makes", will be attributed to the same row with the lemma "make" and
labelled with the part-of-speech (POS) tag "VB" (verb).
</p>

<p>
Our lemmatized lists contain the number of occurences of each lemma in the analyzed part of the corpus
(word <i>frequency</i>). In addition, for each lemma we calculate a dispersion metric which shows
how a given word is spread across the corpus. As a dispersion metric, we use
the <i>Jullian's D parameter</i> (Jullian, 1970) with the correction on the size of each subtitles file with respect
to the analyzed corpus volume (Gries, 2008). We also compute the <i>rank</i> of each word as a product
between the word frequency and the Jullian's D parameter. Computed in this way, the rank can be considered as a measure of importance of each word
in speech.
</p>

<p>
Our wordlists can be used, for example, to
</p>

<ol>
  <li> Choose priority words for studying </li>
  <li> Look for new words (they are at the end of the list!) </li>
  <li> Learn about relative importance of different issues in life (which word is ranked higher - "war" or "love" ?)</li>
</ol>

    POS tags for nouns, proper nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs are grouped according to the following rules:<br>
  </p>
  <p>
    (NN, NNS) --> NN<br>
    (NNP, NNPS) --> NP<br>
    (VBD, VBG, VBN, VBP, VBZ) --> VB<br>

<p style="padding-top:2em;">
<b>NB.</b> We intentionally did not truncate the lists for low word frequencies. This makes it possible to discover
newly-coined words. However, you should be very careful when interpreting data for low word frequencies as it is
likely to be unreliable.
